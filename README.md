# Self-Assessment

My role during our final project was the outline of the presentation and GitHub repository. Starting off, I helped guide our team in setting up our repository along with organizing each teammate's branch. While my other teammates were using each of the technologies we'd need for our project, I was following each step with them, documenting our questions and decisions. When needed, I looked through my teammates projects and helped give peer reviews when needed. I spent time with some of my teammates one on one to make sure that we were all following along the same story line while talking through their processes so I could better communicate it in our documents. My greatest personal challenge was spending time going above and beyond for my teammates. Since their work depended on mine, I made sure to do my very best for the team as a whole. This challenged my time management skills, which I beleive I rose to the challenge for. 

# Team Assessment

Our communication protocol was through slack mainly when we weren't in class hours. Thankfully, we were able to get most of our work done during class hours. We met early before our presentation to go over it multiple times so everyone was comfortable which was extremely helpful. There was some confusion on submitting deliverables as a whole team, and not just one person, so next time I would definitely clarify with my teammates before the Sunday night deadline. Some of our strengths was flexibility. I noticed quite early in our project that everyone was very open to contructive critisism. Another strength was we stood together when a TA or the professor may have questioned us. I think this is very valuable that we didn't turn on each other, but made sure we backed each other up.

# Summary

Our research question was: can we predict Austin housing prices based on a number of factors? The machine model used in this project was a Random Forest Regressor. After spending time working on imporving the parameters of our model, our model proved to be useful after performing better than the Root Mean Squared Error. Our model was two times as effective as using just the simple average to predict the home value.
